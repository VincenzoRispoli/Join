        Welcome to the help page for <span class="blue-text">Join</span>, your guide to using our kanban
        project management tool. Here,
        we'll provide an overview of what <span class="blue-text">Join</span> is, how it can benefit
        you, and how to use it.
        <h2>What is Join?</h2>
        <p><span class="blue-text">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and
            built by a group of dedicated
            students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
            limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span
                class="blue-text">Join</span> leverages the principles of
            kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended
            for
            extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we
            cannot
            guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality
            regarding
            <span class="blue-text">Join</span>.
        </p>
        <h2>How to use it</h2>
        <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="blue-text">Join</span>:</p>



        <ol type="1">
            <li>
                <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project
                and
                contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
            </li>


            <li>
                <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts"
                section,
                click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts
                can
                be
                assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
                individual
                tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
                task
                details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by
                dragging and
                dropping the card from one list to another.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                Deleting a
                card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting
                cards, as
                this action is irreversible.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Remember that using <span class="blue-text">Join</span> effectively requires consistent
            updates from you and your team to
            ensure the board reflects the current state of your project.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Have more questions about <span class="blue-text">Join</span>? Feel free to contact us at
            [Your Contact Email]. We're here to
            help you!</p>
