                        <h2>What is Join?</h2>
                        <p><span class="blue-text">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and
                            built by a group of dedicated
                            students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
                            limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span
                                class="blue-text">Join</span> leverages the principles of
                            kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>It is important to note that Join is designed as an educational exercise and is not intended
                            for
                            extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we

                        </p>
                        <h2>How to use it</h2>
                        <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="blue-text">Join</span>:</p>



                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>
                                <h3>Exploring the Board</h3>
                                When you log in to Join, you'll find a default board. This board represents your project
                                and
                                contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".
                            </li>


                            <li>
                                <h3>Creating Contacts</h3>
                                In Join, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts"
                                section,
                                click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts
                                can
                                be
                                assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <h3>Adding Cards</h3>
                                Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards represent
                                individual
                                tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
                                task
                                details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Moving Cards</h3>
                                As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board by
                                dragging and
                                dropping the card from one list to another.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Deleting Cards</h3>
                                Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete it.
                                Deleting a
                                card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting
                                cards, as
                                this action is irreversible.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
